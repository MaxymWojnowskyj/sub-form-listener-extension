A submission form post request listener chrome extension. Built to be used with the Raffle bot desktop application.

This chrome extension is used as a background listener that will read the submission form data whenever a submission is made in google forms or typeforms. The extension then saves this data in localstorage where the user can access it from the popup menu and download it into a .json file onto their computer. They can then import this .json file into the raffle bot application and use it to make their raffle submissions. 

This extension was built 2 years ago hence the outdated manifest version.

A video demoing how to use the extension can be seen here at this timestamp:
